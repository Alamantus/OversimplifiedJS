    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>The speed gauge in the bottom left corner shows your current speed level. The energy bar next to it shows how long you can go as fast as you are going and refills over time. If you crash into the island, you lose all momentum and your speed resets to 0.</p>
    <p>The bottom right side shows the clock. When the dial rotates back around to the top, the prices of items are all refactored. Time doesn't move when you're on a trade screen.</p>
    <p>You can only buy 20 of one item and you can only hold 3 different kinds of items. Choose wisely!</p>
    <p>You can haggle on an island with a 5% success rate. You can only haggle 5 times per island before they won't let you haggle anymore. If you haggle successfully, buying prices decrease and selling prices increase for the day.</p>
    <p>Throughout the day as you sail, your crew has a small chance of getting ill, which will negatively affect your ship's energy. You can pay to heal at an island's Tavern.</p>
    <p>Press right or left on the Storage screen to show the Map. Green pixels are islands and the red pixel is your current position. You can continue moving forward while the map is pulled up, but you can't control your ship. You have to exit the menu screen to control your ship.</p>
    <p>The game saves at the start of each day. If you stop in the middle of the day, you will lose your progress for that day.</p>

    <p>There's no end game yet, but you can sail around and trade as long as you want. Try to make as much money as you can!</p>
